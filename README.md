# Basic Overview
The Local Login module for Moodle allows users, with local login accounts, such as administrators, to be able to login even if the custom login URL is pointing to some other page such as Oauth2 or other identity management system. The local login page only offers the option of logging in using a local Moodle account.

This is also an example of how to create a custom login page.
